# Person Re-Identification in Challenging Weather Conditions

Welcome to the official repository for our capstone project at Seoul National University of Science and Technology (SeoulTech), Korea. We are students majoring in Electronic Information Engineering, and we have developed a Windows program designed to perform person re-identification (Re-ID) under challenging weather conditions.

**Note:** This repository is currently under development. Please check back in a few days for the complete project.
